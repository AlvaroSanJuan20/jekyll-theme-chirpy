You're a good soldier, choosing your battles
Pick yourself up and dust yourself off, get back in the saddle

You're on the frontline, everyone's watching
You know it's serious, we're getting closer, this isn't over

The pressure's on, you feel it
But you got it all, believe it

When you fall get up, oh, oh
And if you fall get up, eh, eh

Tsamina mina zangalewa 'cause this is Africa
Tsamina mina, eh, eh

Waka waka, eh, eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

Listen to your God, this is our motto
Your time to shine, don't wait in line, y vamos por todo

People are raising their expectations
Go on and feed them, this is your moment, no hesitations

Today's your day, I feel it
You paved the way, believe it

If you get down get up, oh, oh
When you get down get up, eh, eh

Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

Tsamina mina, eh, eh
Waka waka, eh, eh

Tsamina mina zangalewa, anawa-a-a
Tsamina mina, eh, eh

Waka waka, eh, eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa

This time for Africa
Tsamina mina

Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

Tsamina mina, eh, eh
Waka waka, eh, eh

Tsamina mina zangalewa anawa-a-a
Tsamina mina, eh, eh

Waka waka, eh, eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa

This time for Africa
Tango, eh, eh

Tango, eh, eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa anawa-a-a

Tango, eh, eh
Tango, eh, eh

Tsamina mina zangalewa, anawa-a-a
This time for Africa

This time for Africa
We all Africa
We all Africa
